        <p>Your curator is not just a regular teacher. He is the Yoda of ELK
            methodology. He speaks your native language, guides you through
            the whole course, helps you with grammar, ensures you are ready for
            classes with native speakers, and coordinates your materials and homework.
        </p>
        <p>Based on your plans, your curator designs an individual language
            program tailored to your needs. If you are going to London, you can
            practice with Stef and get used to a British accent. If you work
            in a business, you will be talking to Adam who owns a small company.
            If you are interested in the arts, Shawn, a poet from Brooklyn,
            New York will help you with your classes.
